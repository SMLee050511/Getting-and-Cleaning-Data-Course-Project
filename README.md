Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
Purpose of the course project

This course project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
With the goals:
1.	To prepare tidy data for peer review
2.	To link to Github repository with the script to perform the analysis
3.	To prepare the code book that describes the variables, the data and any transformations that being performed to clean up

 The following are the steps to generate the tidy_data.txt:
1.	Download the dataset to the working directory
2.	Load the activity and feature info
3.	Load both the training and test datasets and retain those columns which reflect  mean or standard deviation
4.	Load  and merge the activity and subject data for training and testing dataset respectively
5.	Merge both the training and testing datasets
6.	Convert the activity and subject columns into factors
7.	Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
